ü•∑üèΩ Hi there

Hi there, welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Stevens Bougault and I'm a software developer with a passion for learning and building new things. I initially started out in a completely different field, but decided to make a career change and pursue my interest in coding. I've been teaching myself how to code for some time now, and have been fortunate enough to work as a software developer for the past 18 months.

In my current role, I've gained experience working with various technologies and programming languages, but I'm always looking to learn more and stay up-to-date with modern developments in the field. I'm particularly interested in web development, and I'm excited to continue growing my skills in these areas.

When I'm not coding, you can usually find me playing Call of Duty, practicing Thai boxing, or experimenting in the kitchen with new recipes. I believe that staying active and trying new things is essential for personal growth, and I bring that same mindset to my work as a software developer.

Thanks for stopping by my profile, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat!
